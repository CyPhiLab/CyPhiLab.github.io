# **About CyPhi Lab**

<!-- Hi my name **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br> -->
\
The Cybernetics and Physical Intelligence Laboratory is a research lab at Case Western Reserve University in the department of [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering]((https://engineering.case.edu/mechanical-and-aerospace-engineering)) located in the [Human Fusions Institute](https://humanfusions.org/). The group conducts research on a broad array of topics in robotics, intelligence, biomechanics, and dynamical systems theory. We prioritize generating theoretical advancements as well as practical deployments on hardware and/or codebases. See the [Research]({% link pages/projects.md %}) page for more specific descriptions of ongoing work in the group. Students interested in joining the group should go to the [Prospective Students]({% link pages/Prospective_Students.md %}) page.
